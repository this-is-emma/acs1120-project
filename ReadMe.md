# Nemo Asks.

Welcome to the Nemo Asks repository! This application generates random tweets based on a given set of input data. It utilizes natural language processing techniques such as Markov Chains to create original content. 


Please feel free to visit the [Nemo asks website](https://its-99-questions.onrender.com/)! She is still learning to form intelligible questions; sometimes her thougths dont make any sens but sometimes it actually does! When it happens, tweet it for posterity 🥳
